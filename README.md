# BMW ISTA (Integrated Service Technical Application)

BMW **ISTA** stands for **Integrated Service Technical Application**.  
It is BMW‚Äôs official diagnostic and service software used by dealerships and independent workshops for working on **BMW**, **MINI**, and **Rolls-Royce** vehicles.  

---

## What ISTA Does
- **Diagnostics**: Reads and clears fault codes (DTCs) from all vehicle control units (engine, transmission, ABS, airbag, etc.).
- **Programming & Coding**: Updates or reprograms vehicle control modules with factory software (requires special hardware or licenses).
- **Service Functions**: Provides guided procedures for maintenance and repairs (e.g., bleeding brakes, resetting adaptations, battery registration).
- **Wiring Diagrams & Technical Info**: Includes repair instructions, wiring diagrams, and troubleshooting guides directly from BMW.
- **Vehicle Identification**: Automatically detects the vehicle by VIN and retrieves build data and options.

---

## Components
- **ISTA/D (Diagnostics)**: Focused on troubleshooting, reading data, and performing service functions.
- **ISTA/P (Programming)**: Used for software updates and programming modules (on older setups; newer ISTA integrates both).

---

## Who Uses It
- BMW dealerships (official software).
- Independent BMW specialists with proper hardware and access.
- Advanced enthusiasts who want dealer-level diagnostics.  
  *Note: Full programming functions usually require BMW‚Äôs ICOM interface and a stable power supply.*

üëâ In short: **ISTA is BMW‚Äôs ‚Äúdealer tool‚Äù for diagnostics, coding, and repair guidance**, similar to:
- **VW/Audi** ‚Üí ODIS  
- **Mercedes** ‚Üí Xentry
